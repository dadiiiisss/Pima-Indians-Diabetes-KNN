# Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis with KNN

This project explores and analyzes the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to identify potential patterns and predictors of diabetes using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and build a classification model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## 🧠 Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical records of female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older. Features include:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes)

Dataset source: [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing or zero values in critical columns (e.g. insulin, BMI)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizations of distributions and correlations
   - Insights into features that may affect diabetes outcome
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Standardization and scaling
4. **Modeling**  
   - Train/Test split
   - Classification using Decision Tree / Logistic Regression / other models
5. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall

## 📈 Sample Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap
- Glucose level distribution by outcome
- Age vs BMI scatter plot

## ✅ Result
Achieved a model accuracy of approximately **78%** using KNN.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Glucose and BMI were among the most influential features
- Feature scaling significantly improved model performance
- Further improvement possible with hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods
